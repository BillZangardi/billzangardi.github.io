	Applications and projects I have been a part of:<br/>
	• BCIM - Business Continuity & Incident Management is an internal application launched on both iOS and Android which employees would install and sign up to receive alerts regarding closings and delays. My role on this project was to create the backend API the application would hit in order to get up to date list of locations and to authenticate users, this was created using NodeJS. I also created CMS for administrators to use to add/remove locations and to send the push notification messages to the users.<br/>

	• <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.elsevier.cs.ElsevierCDIReference">Elsevier CDI Reference</a> - The Elsevier CDI Reference Mobile Application is a clinical documentation improvement (CDI) quick reference tool designed to pinpoint for, clinicians and CDI staff, clinical terms or phrases that may be used to accurately and completely describe, in detail, a specific condition. Specific documentation may be used to demonstrate medical necessity for services, justify admission and treatment, and accurately reflect a patients severity of illness. Emphasis is placed on necessary documentation for the ICD-10-CM/PCS coding system. Physician documentation should NEVER include information that is enhanced, modified, or otherwise inaccurate for the purposes of determining or increasing payment, or for any other situation in which a physician or facility may falsely gain.<br/>
